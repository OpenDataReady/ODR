# Open Data Ready standard

This proposal of the new IT standard is published in [COMSODE](http://www.comsode.eu/) [Deliverable D5.5 Contribution to international standards and best practises](http://www.comsode.eu/wp-content/uploads/D5.5_Contribution_to_international_standards_and_best_practices.pdf). It is continuously being improved and updated.

ODR standard that could be adopted by organisations but it can also become part of national legislation.

"Open Data Ready" is a set of principles to follow when doing changes to existing information systems, processes, workflows and organizational structures aimed to prepare them for publication of Open Data later on.

The point is to take the advantage of “projects” that are designed to make changes (old hardware is nearing end of life and needs to be replaced, old software needs to be updated to add additional functionality due to changes in agenda, organizations is being restructured to optimize costs, etc.) and amend their scope with set of “Open Data Ready” requirements which will for little additional costs help execute steps, which will later greatly ease the start of publication of Open Data.

Such approach is deemed cost effective because it is much more efficient to introduce any changes (including those that are Open Data related) in analytical and design phases of almost any project compared to introduction of changes in later phases (implementation, testing, production).

“Open Data Ready” is a set of principles/ requirements, which can be divided into three main categories differentiated on level where the requirements are applicable:

- Dataset level    
- Information Systems level
- Whole organization level (its processes and organizational structure)

Organization can decide at what level they want to apply “Open Data Ready” principles: 
“Open Data Ready” principles can also be adopted at national level, mandating or giving recommendations for all government organizations to follow when executing organizational changes or procuring/implementing new information systems.

To aid such activities even further “Open Data Ready” label can be used for:

- Organizations, that successfully prepare themselves for Open Data
- Information systems, that can readily provide not just intended functionality for primary users, but also provide Open Data to general public

This standard will help public organizations to specify consistent rules that will force suppliers to deliver all information systems with strong support for straightforward automatic publishing of open data. Such systems could be branded as “Open Data Ready”.
